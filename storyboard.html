                    CVS Self-Checkout Station Personas & Storyboarding

                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to analyze how users interact with
                    an interface so that I could better understand its strengths and
                    limitations. In particular, I looked at how CVS shoppers use the
                    self-checkout interface to purchase store items. I first
                    conducted user research to understand their motivations and pain
                    points with using the interface. I then brainstormed personas to
                    match my observations so that I could get a better understanding
                    of the types of users that interact with the self-checkout
                    station. Finally, I created a storyboard to depict a typical
                    user journey of a CVS customer interacting with the interface.

                <p>
                    Users place all items to be purchased in the area left of the
                    scanner
                    and scan each item one by one. Users can interact with the
                    display in
                    order to request help from an employee, proceed to the payment
                    process,
                    change the language, etc. Once all the items have been scanned
                    and are
                    in the bagging area, users pay by using the card reader.

                    This project taught me how important user research is for
                    understanding the strengths and limitations of an interface. I
                    learned how formulate good questions for user research and how
                    to synthesize my research and observations to create more
                    generalized personas. As an aspiring product manager, it will be
                    important for me to use these skills to take a customer-centric
                    approach when designing and implementing a project.
