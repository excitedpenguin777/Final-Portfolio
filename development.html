                </h1>
                <h2 id="context"> Context </h2>
                <p> I created an application to enable users to view and track
                    their completed Rhode Island hiking trails. I first found my
                    hiking trail data on AllTrails to and other online sources.
                    I
                    then brainstormed how I wanted to visually represent each
                    hiking trail and how to design a system for tracking
                    completed trails. Finally, I used React to create the final
                    application. </p>
                <h2 id="inspiration"> Inspiration </h2>

                <p> Hiking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I love spending
                    time outdoors. I have
                    used applications such as AllTrails to find new hiking
                    trails, but wanted to create
                    an interface focused on hiking in Rhode Island. I also am
                    a big fan of Strava, an app that allows users to keep track
                    of their physical exercise. This inspired me to create
                    an interface that allows users to both explore trails and
                    keep track of their distance hiked. </p>

                <h2 id="features"> Features </h2>

                <p> Here are some features that I included in my interface: </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            3 filtering categories
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2 sorting categories
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Functionality to add or remove each hiking trail to
                            aggregator comonent
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aggregator component that tracks total miles
                            hiked
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reset functionality for aggregator and filters/sorts
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </div>

                <h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>

                <p> I built this interface with React and used state and props
                    to create interactive components. In order to allow users to
                    filter and sort data or add hiking trail components to the
                    aggregator, I had to use state variables to make the UI
                    reactive. I used props in order to pass data from the
                    top-level component into other components. </p>
                <button class="button body-button"
                    onclick="window.location='https://excitedpenguin777.github.io/Hiking-Trails-Development/';">
                    View interface
                </button>
                <h2 id="conlcusion"> Conclusion </h2>

                <p class="conclusion">
                    I gained experience using React while developing my
                    application. I learned about how to organize a large
                    amount of code into separate components based on
                    functionality. I also learned how to use state to make an
                    application visually responsive to user interaction.
                    While coding a project like this is usually out of scope for
                    a product
                    manager, it is important to understand
                    frameworks such as React in order to collaborate effectively
                    with
                    engineers.
