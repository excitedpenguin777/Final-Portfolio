        <h1>MyTrails Development
          Redesign</h1>
        <h2 id="context"> Context </h2>
        <p> I created an application to enable users to view and track their completed Rhode Island hiking trails. I first found my hiking trail data on AllTrails and other online sources. I then focused on how I wanted to visually represent each hiking trail and how to design a system for marking completed hiking trails. Finally, I used React State to apply filters and sorts so that users could customize the way they view hiking trail data.  </p>
        <h2 id="inspiration"> Inspiration </h2>

        <p> I am a big hiker and lover of the outdoors. I have enjoyed using applications such as AllTrails, but wanted to create an application focused on hiking in Rhode Island. I also am a big Strava user, where I can keep track of the total distance I have ran over the past month. I wanted to create this application to allow users to both explore trails and keep track of their distance milestones.</p>

        <h2 id="features"> Features </h2>

        <p> Here are some features that I included in my website</p>

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    3 filtering categories
                </li>
                <li>
                    2 sorting categories
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add and remove functionality for each hiking trail
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aggregator component that tracks total miles completed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reset functionality for aggregator and filters/sorts
                </li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <h2 id="website">Website</h2>

        <p> I built this website using React. You can view the finished product <a target="_blank" href="https://excitedpenguin777.github.io/Hiking-Trails-Development/">here</a>!</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 id="conlcusion"> Conclusion </h2>

        <p class="conclusion">
            I gained experience using React while developing my application. I learned a lot about how to organize a large amount of code into separate components based on functionality. I also learned how to use State to make an application responsive and represent user changes visually. While directly coding a project is outside of a product managers scope, it is important to understand different frameworks such as React in order to better collaborate with engineers.
