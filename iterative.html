        <h1>Intuned Iterative Design
          Redesign</h1>
        <h2 id="context"> Context </h2>
        <p> For this group project, I worked on a team to design an interface for a startup called Intuned. Intuned is a startup that provides software which allows teams to connect data from various sources, such as GitHub, Jira, and Notion, and run custom queries to analyze and explore the data. Using Figma, we designed and prototyped an interface to enable users to view their data, edit their teams, and create custom data queries. We attended a design critique and applied feedback to our high-fidelity prototype. Finally, we brainstormed a task for users to complete and conducted user testing on UserTesting.com.  </p>
        <h2 id="usability">Wireframe</h2>
        
        <p> We sketched a wide variety of designs, including where the navigation bar should be placed, how we should display team members, and how dashboards and metric creation should look like. After discussing the different sketches, we decided to implement the following design. We wanted to include notifications on the dashboard page, and we also liked the navigation bar display at the top with a search bar. We also thought that the metrics page was less cluttered and more intuitive in this sketch, as it included a progress bar to tell users how far they were in the process. </p>

        <h3> Initial Draft </h3>

        <p> Here is our interactive high-fidelity mockup of our interface before feedback.</p>

        <div class="figma">
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2Fo9FpXODdTeUAu36U84OEjR%2Fcs1300-iterative-design-before-feedback%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1%26t%3DW6iZ10OTsohT4lHT-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3> Feedback </h3>

        <p> We took our mockup to a critique session and got the following feedback on our mockup. </p>

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Notification icons should have same color— having different colors is a bit distracting
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users should be able to see other notifications when selecting a single notification— try removing the blur from the notifications for the “Notification Click” page
                </li>
                <li>
                    Search bar gets cut off by the MacBook notch when interacting with the prototype. Making it smaller could fix this problem
                </li>
                <li>
                    The profile icon and profile picture have the same functionality— remove one since having both is redundant
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the “My Team” page, there is no need for the team members to be in a carousel view, as this requires more effort than scrolling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Convert the team members display to a normal scrollable view
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consider moving the notification panel to the right side of the “My Dashboard” page to establish better hierarchy; the notifications are subordinate to the dashboard panel
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try leveraging an exit modal to provide a cleaner exit to the “Create metric” flow
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3> Final Version </h3>
        
        <p> We applied the feedback we got during the critique to get this final prototype.</p>

        <div class="figma">
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FaqBnvhI1q1a3EDv55sor1d%2Fcs1300-iterative-design-Final%3Ft%3DW6iZ10OTsohT4lHT-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h2 id="usability">User Testing</h2>

        <p> To investigate the usability of our hifi prototype we used UserTesting.com to see how three users interacted with our interface. Our primary task was to navigate into the metrics page and create a github metric. The overarching task was also divided into two subtasks which was first navigating into the metric page and second successfully creating a github metric.</p>

        <p> Here are the instructions provided for users, as well as their feedback during each task. </p>

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website? Please be specific in your explanation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Feedback: Users universally found the color palette intuitive, noting that the vibrance of the colors made it easy to determine the hierarchy of the colors. Users also mentioned that they found that the usage of modular dashboards aligned with their expectation for Intuned’s intended purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, from the homepage, please locate and navigate to the metrics page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Feedback: Users mentioned that it was easy to both locate, navigate, and click into the metrics’ tab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once in the metrics tab, create a new Github metric. Please continue until you receive confirmation that a new metric is added.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Feedback: Compared to the previous task, users expressed more confusion and difficulty completing the task at hand. Specifically, users mentioned that the labels and buttons were not necessarily clear for creating a new metric.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="conlcusion"> Conclusion </h2>

        <p class="conclusion">
            This project taught me how to design an interface from scratch, from brainstorming initial design sketches to applying feedback on a more polished interface. I also learned how to give and receive design critiques, an important skill for product managers who collaborate and gives feedback to both designers and engineers. Finally, I learned how to conduct user testing and formulate effective tasks to give to test users to understand how to improve an interface further in a future iteration.
