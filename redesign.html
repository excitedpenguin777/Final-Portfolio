        <h1>Berkshire Hathaway Website Responsive
          Redesign</h1>
        <h2 id="context"> Context </h2>
        <p> In this project, I found a poorly designed website, analyzed its
          issues, and prototyped and implemented a redesigned version. I
          analyzed Berkshire Hathaway’s website with respect to usability,
          memorability, learnability, and accessibility in order to determine
          areas that needed improvement. I then wireframe and prototyped a
          redesigned version of the homepage of the website for desktop, tablet,
          and mobile layouts. Finally, I implemented my changes using HTML and
          CSS. </p>
        <h2 id="usability">Usability</h2>
        <p> I chose to look at the <u>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire
              Hathaway Website</a>
          </u>. I chose this website because there are glaring issues with the
          accessibility and organization of the homepage. Below is a
          screenshot of the homepage. </p>
        <img class="modal-image"
          src="./assets/original-page.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Original
          Website" />
        <p class="enlarge"> Click to enlarge</p>
        <h3> Usability Problems</h3>
        <p> Here are some usability problems with the website I noticed: </p>
        <div class="list">
          <li> This website has poor memorability because similar information is
            not organized together. For example, content that would fall under
            the
            “About Us” category (legal, sustainability, corporate governance) is
            scattered. </li>
          <li> The way that information is stored and lack of information on the
            homepage leads to poor usability. For example, you have to click
            twice
            to see a news report (News Releases -> Link -> PDF). This is
            information that should be accessible on the home page so that users
            can learn about the company when they first visit the webpage. </li>
          <li> There is not enough difference in font size between headers and
            other text, which makes it hard to establish hierarchy. Furthermore,
            some of the text on the webpage is too small, which negatively
            affects
            accessibility. </li>
          <li> The navigation links to different types of information are
            included
            in an ordered list of hyperlinks, which negatively affects
            learnability because users have to click on a link to understand
            that
            it is a top-level link that includes more content.</li>
          <li> There is no search bar or function, which makes it hard to find
            specific information if you are first using the site and not sure
            where it lives. This leads to poor usability and learnability. </li>
        </div>
        <h3> Accessibility Problems</h3>
        <p> Next, I used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems.
          The main accessibility problem that WAVE found was that the text that
          indicates when a section was updated is too small. I agree that this
          is an issue, as I personally had trouble reading. A related problem
          that WAVE identified was that the headings are stored as an unordered
          list and are not represented as heading elements; this makes the
          website very hard to navigate and negatively affects the
          accessibility. Finally, WAVE pointed out that there is no lang
          attribute value and that none of the page regions have ARIA landmarks;
          these both negatively affect the user experience of anyone trying to
          navigate the page with assistive technology. </p>
        <h2 id="visual">Visual Redesign</h2>
        <h3> Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
        <p> During the redesign process, I first created lo-fi wireframes to
          address the usability problems I found above. I created wireframes for
          desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.</p>

          <div class="gallery">
            <div>
              <h4 class="centered"> Desktop</h4>

              <img class="modal-image"
                src="./assets/lo-desktop.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Desktop
                Wireframe" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="centered"> Tablet</h4>

              <img class="modal-image"
                src="./assets/lo-tablet.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Tablet
                Wireframe" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="centered"> Mobile</h4>

              <img class="modal-image"
                src="./assets/lo-mobile.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Mobile
                Wireframe" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="enlarge"> Click to enlarge</p>

        <h3> Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
        <p> Next, I defined
          a visual design guide that displays the main colors, typography, and
          reusable components for the redesigned webpage.</p>

        <img class="modal-image"
          src="./assets/guide.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Style Guide"
          />
          <p class="enlarge"> Click to enlarge</p>
        <h3> High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>

        <p> I then designed high-fidelity prototypes for my redesigned webpage
          for
          desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Some displays included multiple
          prototypes in order to fully display the interactive functions of my
          webpage, such as the navigation bar. </p>

        <h4 class="centered"> Desktop</h4>
        
        <div class="figma">
          <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FuaWiOxmM2pdnzkXhqUJ6ck%2FResponsive-Redesign%3Fnode-id%3D9%253A2%26t%3DW6iZ10OTsohT4lHT-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h4 class="centered"> Tablet</h4>

        <div class="figma">
          <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FuaWiOxmM2pdnzkXhqUJ6ck%2FResponsive-Redesign%3Fnode-id%3D9%253A2%26t%3DW6iZ10OTsohT4lHT-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h4 class="centered"> Mobile</h4>

        <div class="figma">
          <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FuaWiOxmM2pdnzkXhqUJ6ck%2FResponsive-Redesign%3Fnode-id%3D9%253A4%26t%3DW6iZ10OTsohT4lHT-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>

        <h2 id="responsive">Responsive Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, I used my wireframes, style guide, and prototypes to design a
          responive webpage that addresses the original usability and
          accessibility
          issues I found with the Berkshire Hathaway website. The website can be
          found <u> <a target="_blank"
              href="https://excitedpenguin777.github.io/Berkshire-Hathaway-Responsive-Redesign/">
              here</a> </u>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="conlcusion"> Conclusion </h2>

        <p class="conclusion">
          I learned about the major design principles, usability, memorability,
          learnability, and accessibility in this project. These are important
          principles to understand as a product manager in order to make good
          design decisions and to recognize poor ones. I also learned how to use
          Balsamiq and Figma for wire framing and prototyping, and I gained more
          experience with HTML and CSS during the development portion of the
          project.
