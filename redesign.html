        <h1>Berkshire Hathaway Website Responsive
          Redesign</h1>
        <h2> Background </h2>
        <p> For this project, I found a poorly designed website and analyzed its
          issues with respect to memorability, learnability, usability, and
          accessibility. Next, I wireframed and prototyped a redesigned website for
          desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts. Finally, I built and deployed the
          redesigned website using HTML and CSS. </p>
        <h2>Website Usability Problems</h2>
        <p> I chose to look at the Berkshire Hathaway Website, linked <u> 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">here</a> </u>. I chose this website because there are glaring issues with the
          accessibility and organization of the homepage. Below is a
          screenshot of the homepage. </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/original-page.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Original
            Website"/>
          <h4> Usability Problems</h4>
          <p> Here are some usability problems with the website I noticed: </p>
          <li> This website has poor memorability because similar information is
            not organized together. For example, content that would fall under the
            “About Us” category (legal, sustainability, corporate governance) is
            scattered. </li>
          <li> The way that information is stored and lack of information on the
            homepage leads to poor usability. For example, you have to click twice
            to see a news report (News Releases -> Link -> PDF). This is
            information that should be accessible on the home page so that users
            can learn about the company when they first visit the webpage. </li>
          <li> There is not enough difference in font size between headers and
            other text, which makes it hard to establish hierarchy. Furthermore,
            some of the text on the webpage is too small, which negatively affects
            accessibility. </li>
          <li> The navigation links to different types of information are included
            in an ordered list of hyperlinks, which negatively affects
            learnability because users have to click on a link to understand that
            it is a top-level link that includes more content.</li>
          <li> There is no search bar or function, which makes it hard to find
            specific information if you are first using the site and not sure
            where it lives. This leads to poor usability and learnability. </li>
          <h4> Accessibility Problems</h4>
          <p> Next, I used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems.
            The main accessibility problem that WAVE found was that the text that
            indicates when a section was updated is too small. I agree that this
            is an issue, as I personally had trouble reading. A related problem
            that WAVE identified was that the headings are stored as an unordered
            list and are not represented as heading elements; this makes the
            website very hard to navigate and negatively affects the
            accessibility. Finally, WAVE pointed out that there is no lang
            attribute value and that none of the page regions have ARIA landmarks;
            these both negatively affect the user experience of anyone trying to
            navigate the page with assistive technology. </p>
          <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Visual Redesign</h2>
          <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h4>
          <p> During the redesign process, I first created lo-fi wireframes to
            address the usability problems I found above. I created wireframes for
            desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.</p>
  
          <h4> Desktop</h4>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/lo-desktop.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Desktop Wireframe"/>
  
          <h4> Tablet</h4>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/lo-tablet.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Tablet Wireframe"/>
  
          <h4> Mobile</h4>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/lo-mobile.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Mobile Wireframe"/>
  
          <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> Visual Design Style Guide</h4>
          <p> Next, I defined
            a visual design guide that displays the main colors, typography, and
            reusable components for the redesigned webpage.</p>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/guide.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Style Guide"/>
          <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3"> High-Fidelity Prototyping</h4>
  
          I then designed high-fidelity prototypes for my redesigned webpage for
          desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Some displays included multiple
          prototypes in order to fully display the interactive functions of my
          webpage, such as the navigation bar.
  
          <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3 text-center text-weight-bold"> Desktop</h4>

          <img
            src="./assets/hi-desktop3.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Desktop Prototype 3"/>
  
          <h4> Tablet</h4>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/hi-tablet1.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Tablet Prototype 1"/>
  
          <img
            src="./assets/hi-tablet2.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Tablet Prototype 2"/>
  
          <h4> Mobile</h4>
  
          <img src="./assets/hi-mobile.png" alt="Berkshire Hathaway Redesign Mobile Prototype"/>
  
          <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
          Finally, I used my wireframes, style guide, and prototypes to design a responive webpage that addresses the original usability and accessibility issues I found with the Berkshire Hathaway website. The website can be found <u> <a target="_blank" href="https://excitedpenguin777.github.io/Berkshire-Hathaway-Responsive-Redesign/"> here</a> </u>. Below are screenshots of the website for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.
